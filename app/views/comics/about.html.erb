        <strong>XamComiX</strong> is an app created by team <em>Uncle Sam</em> with Sam Ferrer and Xam Abados
        of batch 2021-2023 Business Information Technology students of
        Red River College Polytechnic for their Full-Stack Web Development class,
        Intro to Rails project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chosen data source is Xamâ€™s comic book collection over the years
        where he listed down each <em>comic book</em>, its <em>writers</em>,
        <em>editions</em>, <em>formats</em>, and also its <em>publishing company</em>
        in an excel file and later on exported it into CSV files.
      </p>
        <p>
          Overall, as of right now, the comics table contains a
          total of 330 rows as this is the primary data
          for this application. And we access this data and other tables
          by parsing through each CSV file and using the Rails framework,
          seed it in the database.

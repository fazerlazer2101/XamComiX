        <strong>XamComiX</strong> is an app created by team <em>Uncle Sam</em> with Sam Ferrer and Xam Abados.
        2021-2023 Business Information Technology students of
        Red River College Polytechnic for their Full-Stack Web Development class - Intro to Rails project.

        The application's data source is Xamâ€™s comic book collection through the years
        where he listed down each <em>comic book</em>, its <em>writers</em>,
        <em>editions</em>, <em>formats</em>, and its <em>publishing company</em>
        in an excel file and later on exported it into CSV files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, as of 2023, the comics table contains a
        total of 329 rows as this is the primary data
        for this application. We access this data and other tables
        by parsing through each CSV file and using the Rails framework,
        seed it in the database.
